I tested the following sample sizes: 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, and 10,000,000. For samples below 10,000, the execution time was consistently 0.00 seconds. At the 100,000 scale, the differences were not significant. However, at larger scales—10 million (4.09 sec, 3.36 sec, 1.12 sec) and 100 million (35.49 sec, 29.50 sec, 12.45 sec)—the insertion speeds of both the tree structures and the hash did not improve significantly.
